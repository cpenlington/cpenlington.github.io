<div class = "titleblock"> 
  <p>Hello! My name is Chelsea Penlington. 
    I am a recent graduate of the Environmental Science and Resorces program at Trent University and currently enrolled in the 
    Geographic Informations System - Applications Specialist program at Fleming College.
    My love for maps began in a random Cartography lecture I attended on a whim my first year of university. 
    The woman teaching the course talked about map projections as if they were the most interesting thing in the world. 
    Her entusiam for the subject and my subsequent interest was what got me to begin incorporating GIS into my cirriculum. 
    I have worked in a few fields within the GIS realm but my favorite by far is remote sensing and spatial analysis. 
    I think it is really cool that we can build mapping products and tools to solve environmental problems. 
    If my interests and skills align with your companies goals please find my contact information on the contacts page located on the navigation bar 
    at the top of this webpage.
